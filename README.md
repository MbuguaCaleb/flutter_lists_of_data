```
map function like in javascript loops through a list of data and for each item in
that list it performs a function.

map function returns an iterable.

**Advantages of classes**
```
(a)Helps out in abstraction/modularization of code thus enabling separation of concerns
which is a very good practice for coding.

(b)A constructor is what takes values in when we instantiate a class.It is good practice to have
the name of the constructor similar to that of the class.

(c)Named parameters is an awesome concept that simplifies the instantiation of the classes in that
you now do not have to put your parameters in a particular order since they are now named.

(d)'${quote.text}' we need '$' when we are outputting a variable into a string
and '${object.prop}' and curly braces and a dot when outputting into an object.

(e)It is very good practice to prototype the  List<Quote> or List<String> it helps you enforce
strict types and ensures lesser mistakes from your code.
